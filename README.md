BAyesian Rreference analysis in the Background Interference 

BAyesian Reference analysis in the Background Interference (BARBI) provides a reproducible workflow to remove DNA contamination in shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data.

An application to BARBI: Combined use of metagenomic sequencing and host response profiling for the diagnosis of suspected sepsis. [Paper Available](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/854182v2.article-metrics)
